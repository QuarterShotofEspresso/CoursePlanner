# OSCP: Open Source Course Planner

## Introduction
Writing a course plan can be a tedious process. Balancing just two factors like prerequisites and course offerings for only ten courses can become a headache. And some of us like to factor in the difficulty of each course to make sure we’re not overwhelmed/underperforming for a one-off term. What’s worse is when a carefully developed course plan fails to hold (due to limited seat availability/the school changing when a course is offered/or even a small error while drafting your plan) which means pouring more of your time into course planning. OSCP or Open Source Course Planner is a universal course planing utility for college student to help minimize the amount of time we spend on developing course plans. By universal, we mean this course planner should (theoretically) work for any university's system. We make this claim by observing that colleges use the following two metrics for determining how courses progress: prerequisites and course offerings. Some universities use additional metrics like corequisites or consecutive courses, etc. OSCP provides tools for each of the above metrics and more. This article discusses how to utilize these tools in order to automate as much of your course planning process as possible.

> OSCP is not a course planner in the one-term sense; i.e. it does not plan courses for one term--checking for time conflicts, seat availability, etc. Many universities already offer their own course planning utility for such purposes. OSCP is a course planner which, given a list of courses, their prerequisites, when they're offered, and their difficulty, can compile a course plan while minimizing the number of years to complete those courses.
